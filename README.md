Spring Data REST is a part of the Spring Data project, which is an umbrella project that makes it easier to build data access layers in a Spring application. Spring Data REST is designed to simplify building hypermedia-driven RESTful web services using Spring Data repositories. It essentially exposes your data model as HTTP resources and provides a way to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your data through HTTP.

Key features of Spring Data REST include:

Automatic CRUD operations: Spring Data REST automatically generates RESTful endpoints for your Spring Data repositories. This means you can expose your data model without having to write a lot of boilerplate code for HTTP request handling.
HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State): Spring Data REST follows the principles of HATEOAS, allowing clients to navigate the API and understand the available resources and their relationships.
Customization: You can customize the default behavior of Spring Data REST by configuring it using annotations, Java Configuration, or XML configuration. This allows you to control which repositories are exposed, the URL paths for resources, and more.
Paging, sorting, and filtering: Spring Data REST provides built-in support for paging, sorting, and filtering data through HTTP request parameters, making it easy for clients to retrieve data in a controlled manner.
Security: You can secure your Spring Data REST API using Spring Security, which allows you to define access controls and authentication mechanisms for your API.
